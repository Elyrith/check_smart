Name: check_smart

This is a small Nagios plugin that uses smartmontools (smartctl) to check your
drive S.M.A.R.T. data and reports back.

The plugin complies with the Nagios guidelines, for example uses -w -c -v
arguments etc. It also does some basic sanity checks and has a exit 3 catchall.

check_smart is just a modification of check_md5 by Jack-Benny Persson

IMPORTANT:
This script needs to run as a privileged user (like root or sudo) because
of smartctl. The most secure method I've found so far is:

In commands.cfg...
command_line   sudo $USER1$/check_smart --drive '$ARG1$'

Create a new file /etc/sudoers.d/nagios and add this line to it
(Use your own path)
nagios ALL=(ALL) NO PASSWD:/path/to/script/check_smart

Depending on your distro of Linux/BSD, you may need to check in
/etc/sudoers to make sure this line either doesn't exist or it's commented out:

#Defaults requiretty

These steps will tell Nagios to run the command with sudo, and tell the OS that
the Nagios user is allowed to run that script as sudo without a password. For
maximum security, make sure you check the permissions on check_smart so only
the correct users/groups can modify it.
